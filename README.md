# Creative++

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/violetcraze/CreativeXX.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/violetcraze/CreativeXX)

An experiment to see if I can make my own c++ library for real time creative graphics.

Not useable at the moment, I suggest you checkout [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) or [Cinder](https://www.libcinder.org/) unless you want something that's very incompleate.

Contributions are welcome although there's very minimal documentation (which will hopefully be fixed soon). Currently Linux is the only supported platform.
